The run_analysis.R script should run with no issues if the data is located in the working directory. It creates two data sets--Final_Data.txt and Subject_Averages.txt. 

Final_Data.txt is a 10299 x 68 data set that contains all of the features with "mean()" and "std()" from the X_train and X_test data sets combined with the subject IDs and activity types.

Subject_Averages.txt is an 180 x 68 data set that contains the mean for each of the selected features by subject and activity type. There is 6 observations or rows for each of the 30 subjects.
